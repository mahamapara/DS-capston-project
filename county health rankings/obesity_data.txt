2016 - frequent physical distress, frequent mental distress??, insufficient sleep. added residential segregation (was there the 1st time)
2015 - social association rate
2014 - mental health, housing issues, drinking water violation, health care costs, access to health care, 
children eligible for free lunch

2020- reading scores, math scores: average grade performances

add age-adjusted mortality? 2019 has it

add mental health, some housing issues

should I go back in years and get the over 65 and under 18 in demographics to have an age group

questions?
1. what is the food environment index: 
The food environment index combines two measures of food access: the percentage of the population that is low-income and 
has low access to a grocery store, and the percentage of the population that did not have access to a reliable source of 
food during the past year (food insecurity).

2. what's the segregation index
3. how are the rankings calculated
4. what's % receiving hba1c: HBA1c monitoring

column combinations:
1. PSED rate, some college % have been combined. Most of it is % some college. but b/c there is some psed, kept it as that.

2. what to do for afgr and hs grad rate?

4. length of life = mortality

5. quality of life = morbidity

6. there was only binge drinking in 2010. exessive dirnking started 2011 and binge drinking stopped 2012. 
so do not pay attention to binge drinking. data from 2010 binge drinking will be put in for 2010. 



train set is from 2010 to 2017
test is form 2018 to 2020

so model can't include things only introduced in 2018 to 2020. also need to be cautious of things included 
later in the trainign set years. 

so things that will definitely not be included in the model, and so that missing data doesn't have to dealt with:
1. ypll_black/white/hispanic -- 2018
2. life expectancy and life expectancy_black/white/hispanic -- 2019
3. binge drinking -- stopped collection on 2012
4. % receiving hba1c_black and white ---2018
5. AFGR -- stopped in 2014
6. income inequality GINI index (stopped 2011)
7. % no emotion social support (stopped in 2015)
8. % access to healthy food (stopped in 2013)
9. % fast food (stopped in 2014)
10. access rec facility (stopped in 2014)
11. park access (stopped in 2014)
12. liquor store density (stopped 2012)

dependent variable: adult_obesity_percent
included in model (predictors):
1. food env index started 2014. keeping it
2. health outcomes rank
3. health factors rank
4. life length rank
5. life quality rank
6. health behaviour rank
7. clinical care rank
8. socio-econ rank
9. physical env rank
10. premature death ypll rate (not including premature deaths)
11. poor or fair health %
12. avg poor physical health days
13. adult smoking %
14. excessive drinking %
15. uninsured %
16. % diabetes (not including # of diabetics)
17. % receiving HBA1c monitoring (stoppped in 2019)
18. HS grade rate (started 2014)
19. PSED/college grad rate (mixed these together) PSED completion rate
20. unemployed %
21. income inequality income ratio (started 2015)
22. % limited healthy food access (started 2012)
23. % food insecure (started 2014)
24. % access to exercise opportunities (started 2014)
25. physical inactivity % (started 2011)
26. median household income (started 2011)
27. all racial info --6 races (started 2011) [non hispanic white started 2013]
28. not english proficient (started 2011)
29. female (started 2011)
30. rural (started 2011)
31. County

on the fence:
residential segregation index (started 2016)
(do plots on this)

plots and correlations to see:
histogram: obesity

smoking and obesity
drinking and obesity

smoking and drinking

uninsured and obesity

diabetes % and obesity

% recieving hba1c and obesity



should indexes like food_env_index be treated as ranka nd standardized as such?
